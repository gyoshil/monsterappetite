              <p> In the following section, you will be presented with different snack items to choose from and your selected items will be delivered to you in the next 3-5 business days. Each page will contain similar items (e.g., selection of potato chips, selection of brownies, selection of candies) and you will have 5 different pages with unique items per page. You are required to choose one item per page. To help you with your choice there is information provided for each item in the page that you are welcome to explore. 
              <br><br>

              Though some items are cartoonized for copyright reasons, they are all real snacks. No payment needs to be made at any point of the activity. Just a mailing address is required to receive the items. You will be asked for a mailing address at the end of the entire study (e.g., end of Session 2). In addition, we will send a survey out after you have received and tried the snacks for your feedback on taste. 
              <br><br>

              The first page in this activity contains <u> different kinds of cookies</u>. Remember that you can learn about your items before you make your final choice. To make a selection you can click on the food item. To show that your choice has been entered the radio button besides your choice will be ticked. When you are ready to take a look at the first set of items click the button below.</p>
