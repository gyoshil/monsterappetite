              <p > In the following section, you will be presented with different snack items to choose from and your selected items will be delivered to you in the next 3-5 business days. Each page will contain similar items (e.g., 3 different kinds of potato chips) and you will have 6 different pages with unique items per page. You are required to choose one item per page. Though all items are cartoonized for copyright reasons, they are all real snacks. No payment needs to be made at any point of the activity. Just a mailing address is required to receive the items. You will be asked for a mailing address at the end of the 6 pages of snack items. In addition, the principal investigator will send a survey out after you have received and consumed the snacks for your taste evaluation, as non-commonly available snacks are provided as options. 
              <br><br>
