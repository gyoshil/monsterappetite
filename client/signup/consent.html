      <p><strong>WHAT IS A RESEARCH STUDY?</strong><br> 
          Research is the careful study of an issue that is not fully understood. Research studies are carried out by investigators to find new knowledge and reach a better understanding. Participating in a research study may not help you or others but may help researchers begin to figure out a problem. Participating in a research study is always voluntary- you decide whether you want to participate or not. If you agree to participate, you can always change your mind with no penalties. Feel free to ask questions so you are comfortable about participating. The first step is reading and signing this informed consent.</p><br>

      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br>
          You are being invited to participate in this research study called “Message framing in a digital environment.” You may qualify to take part in this research study because you are over 18 years old and have lived in the United States. Approximately 500 people will participate in this study and it will take <code><strong class="bg-danger">two separate sessions</strong></code> (Session 1 and 2) in <code><strong class="bg-danger">a span of two days</strong></code> to complete the entire study. Session 1 and 2 will take about 20-30 minutes of your time respectively. Therefore, a <code><strong class="bg-danger">total time</strong></code> of <code><strong class="bg-danger">no longer than 40-50 minutes</strong></code> is expected to complete the entirety of this study. Payment is provided for participating in the <code><strong>two-session online study</strong></code>.</p><br>

      <p><strong>WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE? </strong><br>
          I am interested to see if exploring a digital game environment will influence different types of perceptions and actions. </p><br>

      <p><strong>WHAT WILL I BE ASKED TO DO IF I AGREE TO TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY? </strong><br>
          If you decide to participate, you will be asked to participate in a <code><strong class="bg-danger">two-part online study</strong></code> with the <code><strong class="bg-danger">total time not to exceed 40-50 minutes</strong></code> that will be split into two sessions (Session 1: ~30 min and Session 2: ~20 minutes respectively). During the two sessions you will be asked to answer questionnaires about your demographic information and snacking behavior, play a game related to snack foods, and select snacks from a site for delivery. Some of the questionnaires will include questions that ask about your personal eating and snacking behaviors and habits. All of your answers to your questionnaires and your snack selections will be recorded digitally. In addition, your gameplay will be recorded by the game as you play it (e.g., selection of items, speed of selections, etc.). If you do not wish all your answers and digital activities to be recorded, you will not be able to participate. You will be given a randomly generated ID number in order to keep your identity confidential. However, your email account will be required in order for the investigator to contact you before Session 2. The account that would be contacting you for Session 2 is under the name “Principal Investigator” at monsterappetite499@gmail.com. All associated Google applications (e.g., Google+, Hangout) are disabled with this account so that no identifying information of any Google account holder is revealed. </p><br>

      <p><strong>WHAT POSSIBLE RISKS OR DISCOMFORTS CAN I EXPECT FROM TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY? </strong><br>

          The risks involved in this study to you are the same as you may experience in daily life while taking routine physical or psychological examinations or tests or playing video games. These include boredom, fatigue, or frustration during play. However, if at any point of the study you feel uncomfortable, you can stop participating at any time, with no penalty, by simply leaving the web page or closing your Internet browser. The principal investigator is taking precautions to keep your information confidential and prevent anyone from discovering or guessing your identity, such as using a de-identified code instead of your name and keeping all information on a password protected computer. </p><br>
      <p><strong>WHAT POSSIBLE BENEFITS CAN I EXPECT FROM TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY? </strong><br>
          There is no direct benefit to you for participating in this study. Participation may benefit the field of nutrition education to better understand effective ways and mediums to deliver a health message. </p><br>
      <p><strong>WILL I BE PAID FOR BEING IN THIS STUDY? </strong><br>
          Yes. You will be entered into a <code><strong class="bg-danger">raffle to win a $50 gift card </strong></code>for <em>Amazon</em>. You will have a 1/50 chance of winning the raffle. There are no costs to you for taking part in this study. You will be entered into the raffle only after you have completed both Session 1 and 2 and if you pass the attention checks that will be spread out in the questionnaires. Attention checks are questions that require answers to make sure that you are thinking about the questions and your response to them. <code><strong class="bg-danger"> Failing the attention checks implies that you may be answering randomly and your responses cannot be used.  In this case, you will not be paid because your responses will be excluded from the data analysis of this study.</strong> </code></p><br>


      <p><strong>WHEN IS THE STUDY OVER? CAN I LEAVE THE STUDY BEFORE IT ENDS? </strong><br>

          The study is over when you have completed Session 2 of the study, ending with an exit survey. However, you can cease your participation in the study at any time even if you haven’t finished, without penalty. However, you will be entered into the raffle only when you have completed the entire study.  </p><br>


      <p><strong>PROTECTION OF YOUR CONFIDENTIALITY</strong><br>
          The investigator will keep all digital information on an encrypted hard drive and backed up in a secure, cloud-based service (e.g., Box) account that are both password protected. Your information is de-identified. Regulations require that research data be kept for at least three years. </p><br>


      <p><strong>HOW WILL THE RESULTS BE USED? </strong><br>
          The results of this study will be published in journals and presented at academic conferences. Generally, only group data will be used, but if an individual’s data is shared, no identifying information will appear; only anonymous pseudonyms will be used. This study is being conducted as part of the dissertation of the principal investigator. </p><br>


      <p><strong>WHO MAY VIEW MY PARTICIPATION IN THIS STUDY </strong><br>

          Nobody, as the study does not require you to come to a physical place or require you to be video recorded.</p><br>


      <p><strong>CONSENT FOR FUTURE CONTACT </strong><br>

          The investigator may wish to contact you in the future via the email address you provide in the beginning of the study. If you do not give permission to be contacted in the future you can indicate that at the end of the study during the exit survey. The exit survey will include a question asking if the researcher can contact you in the future or not. This only appears at the end of the study because the nature of this two-session study (24 hours apart) requires that the researcher contacts you while the study is in session. </p><br>
