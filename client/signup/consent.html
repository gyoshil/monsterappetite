      <p><h4><strong>Protocol Title</strong>: What are the Effects of Message Framing in a Digital Game Medium? <br><br>
         <strong>Principal Investigator</strong>: Maria Hwang, Teachers College, 614-313-3930</h4></p>
      <p><strong>WHAT IS A RESEARCH STUDY?</strong><br> 
          Research is the careful study of an issue that is not fully understood. Research studies are carried out by principal investigators to find new knowledge and reach a better understanding. Participating in a research study may not help you or others but may help researchers begin to figure out a problem. Participating in a research study is always voluntary- you decide whether you want to participate or not. If you agree to participate, you can always change your mind. Feel free to ask questions so you are comfortable about participating. The first step is reading and signing this informed consent. </p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br>
          You are being invited to participate in this research study called “Effectiveness of message framing in games.” You may qualify to take part in this research study because you are over 18 years old. Approximately 500 people will participate in this study and it will take two separate sessions in a span of two days to complete the entire study. Session 1 is not to exceed 30 minutes and Session 2 is not to exceed 20 minutes of your time.</p>

      <p><strong>WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE? </strong><br>
          I am interested to see if different digital games will affect people’s perceptions on a nutrition subject. </p>

      <p><strong>WHAT WILL I BE ASKED TO DO IF I AGREE TO TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY? </strong><br>
          If you decide to participate, you will be asked to participate in a two-part online study with the total time not to exceed 50 minutes that will be split into two sessions (Session 1: ~30 min and Session 2: ~20 minutes respectively). During the two sessions you will be asked to answer questionnaires regarding demographic information and snacking behavior, play a game related to per-serving calories of snack foods (commonly found in United States’ grocery stores), and select snacks from a site for delivery. Some of the questionnaires will include questions that ask about your personal eating and snacking behaviors and habits. All of your answers to your questionnaires and your snack selections will be recorded digitally. Your gameplay will be recorded through the game (e.g., selection of items, speed of selections, etc.). If you do not wish all your answers and digital activities to be recorded, you will not be able to participate. You will be given a randomly generated ID in order to keep your identity confidential. However, your email account will be required in order for the principal investigator to contact you for Session 2. The account that would be contacting you for Session 2 is under the name “Principal Investigator” at monsterappetite499@gmail.com. All associated Google applications (e.g., Google+) are disabled with this account so that no identifying information of any Google account holder is revealed.</P>
