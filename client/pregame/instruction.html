          <p>The image below shows a screenshot of a round in the game, <em><strong>Monster Appetite</strong></em>, you are about to play. On the left is the board from which you choose the food items. The <strong class="bg-danger">blue</strong> circle shows a snack that has been selected indicated by the tag with the per-serving calories of that chosen item. As you can see the items that have not been selected doesn't have a tag with the calories on them. The selected items are also shown on the right of the page like you can see in the orange circle. The place where the <strong class="bg-danger">orange</strong> circle is will always indicate the last item you have chosen in the game. The <strong class="bg-danger">green</strong> circle will show your monster's name and next to that in the <strong class="bg-danger">purple</strong> indicates the accumulative calories your monster has consumed throughout all the rounds you have played. Last, the <strong class="bg-danger">red</strong> circle on the top left indicates how much time is left in the round you are in. It will count down from 20 for each round. Once the clock hits 0:00 you will no longer be able to select any more foods and feed your monster for that round. </p>
