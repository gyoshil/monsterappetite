          <p > <h4>In the following section, you will be presented with different snack items to choose from and your selected items will be delivered to you in the next 3-5 business days. Each page will contain similar items (such as 3 different kinds of potato chips) and you will have 6 different pages with unique items per page. You are required to choose one and only one item per page. Think of this activity as choosing items on <em>Amazon</em> for delivery. Though all items are cartoonized for design interface reasons, they are all real snacks. Though you will choose snack items and place them in your cart, no payment needs to be made. Just a mailing address is required to receive the items. You will be asked for a mailing address at the end of the 6 pages of snack items.

          The first page in this activity contains 3 different kinds of cookies. Would you like to take a look at the items or would you like us to choose one for you so you can move on to the next page with a different item?</h4></p>
