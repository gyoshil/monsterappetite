		  <h4>Thank you for participating in the second part of this study. <strong class="text-danger">This concludes your participation in this study</strong>. At this point we would like to inform you of the purpose of this study in detail and discuss your compensation for participating in this study. 
		  <br><br>
		  This study wanted to see if a particularly framed message (e.g., eating MORE calories will lead to type 2 diabetes vs. eating LESS calories will PREVENT you gaining weight) in a game environment will affect one's decision making process in snack purchases. Because we wanted to see what types of snacks one would choose without the influences of brand loyalty, familiarity, allergies, etc. we created fake snack items, which were the cartoonized snacks that you saw in <em>Snackazon</em>. So first of all, the cartoonized items were not real items but fake. Therefore, the snacks you have chosen on <em>Snackazon</em> will not be delivered to you but instead a small amount virtual money will be awarded to you when you leave your <strong><em>email address</em></strong> below. We appreciate your time and your participation will inform educators and designers in the field of game-based learning and design to create more informative games that help users learn new information and use that newly learned information in a constructive way. If you have any questons or concerns regarding this study please contact the principal investigator at <strong><em><u>monsterappetite499@gmail.com</u></em></strong>. from   preferred
