gain,Is number of calories really the most important thing to consider?
gain,Monsters were cute. I liked my monster name. There weren't really many healthy choices offered in the monster games. I snack all the time but I would never eat most of that stuff.

gain,I often didn't have more than one reason to choose a snack over another, if they all tasted the same it just boiled down to caloric content (for the first 2-3 choices I didn't notice the "more info" button so I selected based on packaging though). 
gain,It was a bit confusing because the calories don't seem to be corresponding to the amount of sugar and fat. Some items had less calories while containing more sugar/fat than other items. Also, it would be good to see how much salt is contained since salty snacks are usually unhealthy..and again, most snacks (like chips or salsa etc) are salty. I like the graphic a lot!!

loss,Some picture options in the game were unclear - Some items seemed to be sharing the same image. /  / In picking out and organizing 3 reasons for picking certain items, some options were inapplicable for the illustrated ones -  'Taste' for example. /  / There were two of the same questionnaires. (I read them through and double checked but I think they were the same..) Was it intended? Or was it to see the changes in choices after a certain stage?

loss,It would be nice to have a more clear definition of "snack foods" for the survey. When I think of snack foods I think of hummus, apples, bananas, so most of the snacks that appeareed were not things I would eat.
gain,0
gain,Why did some questions ask you to "select the fourth option" or "select the choice that says chocolate" ?
gain,0
loss,I was unclear about whether or not this survey was taking into consideration healthy snacks during the questionaire portions (i.e. nuts, avocado, fruit, vegetables, whole wheat crackers, hummus, salsa). My snacking habits are primarily concerned with these types of items and rarely with sugary pastries, ice cream, full-fat chips, etc. My answers may have changed if I knew whether or not this survey was referring exclusively to "fatty/high-calorie" snacks or any kind of snacks. 
gain,When we get to the part where we have to say the top three reasons we picked a particular snack, it was hard for me to remember, especially for generic looking snacks (cartoonized snacks). It would be helpful to be able to click and see info about the snack.

gain,This is interesting! I am confused ... I will have to submit the first portion of the study, since it has a timer of just a couple of hours. I take it you'll open a second HIT tomorrow? Anyway, thanks for allowing me to participate, and I hope you have a great day!

gain,One's personal definition of "snack food" plays into the results for this immensely. For instance, I consider carrots a snack food, and that's the type of snack I generally choose. If the questions apply specifically to unhealthy foods like chips and cookies, that should be made clear in each question. 
loss,Interesting!!

gain,The "Get Info" button should show all health facts by default. It wasn't until the second round of selections that I realized I could click the button twice. The reasons for selection should include an "Other" option, or allow me to pick 1-2 options. I selected, "Didn't put much thought..." because I had to pick three options.
gain,The game certainly highlighted the idea that one should look at calories.  Although I wonder if it is a priming effect.
loss,N/A thanks!
gain,0
gain,it would be better if we can see how much more questions left for completion of the session!
gain,The time limit in the game portion was a little short and I might have missed picking items for one or more pages because the next page didn't start at the top and I didn't realize that it was on the next page of selections with the timer already running down. It was also unclear what several of the food items were as the images were stretched and the labels hard to read. 
gain,When rating the snack delivery options, most of the time my reasons were: / 1) calories / 2) fat content (this was not an option) /  / and that was it. So because I was forced to pick three options, I chose "ingredients" and "did not give much thought" which really meant, I didn't give a third thought. /  / Also the Monster part was confusing, because I couldn't tell which snacks would have the lowest calories. We should've gotten some feedback as we progressed. For example, I was surprised that popcorn sometimes was low (so it had no butter??) and sometimes was higher. I'm not sure how we would have learned which one was lower without trial and error. Also, pretzels can have a lot of calories if the portion size is too high, or if it's flavored, but these weren't clear...

loss,That was a lot of fun!! I'm sorry that it ended. I have been struggling with getting myself to think about eating better. And I felt a bit differently after playing the game about being such a snack-horse. :)  It will be interesting to see if I continue to feel different. Please invite me for the second part!
loss,nice survey
gain,0
gain,The time given is too short, I couldn't keep up. It feels boring after a while. But that's also when I start to click on any items that I buy normally to check out their caloric content, since I realize I couldn't beat the time if I put too much thought into my clicking. So overall, it was still quite an educational experience. 
loss,0
gain,It was so long. :D But I think the most frustrating thing (maybe intentional? :D) was that I kept focusing on picking snacks that were the lowest in calories (in the game). I thought this was bad because things like pretzels might have low calories but they are empty calories. While veggies and hummas would have more calories they are better for you (keeping calories mostly in balance, of course).
gain,I feel like when you say snack food it's classifying snack food as unhealthy food. If I was to snack I wouldn't go to the options that were presented. I would choose all natural, fresh produce, and not processed foods that were provided. Snacks can be healthy, it's just depends on what you're eating. /  / I also think just looking at calories is a terrible way to determine if something is healthy or not. I also think that fats are important. I think there is a misconception in the US that fat in foods make you fat. I don't think this is true. I actually try to seek out foods high in healthy fats and low in refined sugars (which I think is more deadly).

loss,I found the game [around having foods delivered] slightly contrived inasmuch as I knew I would not actually get the objects, although it might be interesting to know how the Amazon winners actually spend their money! Also, I'm not sure that I followed the game around picking 3 items correctly; moreover, as I recall, one of the game boards had the same object twice, but different numbers showed up when I clicked them.

gain,I was not sure if I should memorize the calories of the illustrated snacks. When I was playing the Monster Appetite game those were the  crucial information but I did not have any clue which one to choose as I did not memorize them. Also when I listed up the reasons I picked the one snack from three,  I was not sure what the "gift for friend" choice did with the way I picked for the snack.
loss,0
loss,During the monster game, sometimes duplicates of certain foods would show up. Also sometimes I clicked one later on because out of curiosity about how much calories were in it. Also if you made it so that you have calorie thresholds and you get something for them or you "win/lose" for it, it could make it so I want to click high calorie things more.
loss,Enjoyed.

gain,I assumed the "didn't put much thought into my selection" meant that I could put that on the list after the first two reasons were the only reasons that I made the choice that I did.

loss,The monster game seemed a little forced. The instructions clearly indicated to pick the food items I thought contained the most calories, so that's what I did. Pretty obvious that constantly choosing the items with the most calories would eventually kill the monster, but I was uncertain if that was your actual aim or not. If I had gone against the game instructions by not picking the items with the highest amount of calories (which is how I would typically behave), would this have been against your intentions? What I mean to say is: I'm uncertain if the game is meant to reflect actual consumer choices, or if you wanted your participants to behave in a certain way so as to specifically enforce a certain attitude towards snacking.

gain,When purchasing food/ snack, I consider sugar/ fat/ nutrition/calories. So when you ask what influence me to consider those items, you didn't have sugar/ fat amount for me to choose. To me, those are the number one thing I look BEFORE numbers of calories. I will not choose zero gram sugar because those items tend to have the highest amount of fat.  /  / Your game was a bit confusing. I thought i HAVE TO choose 3 snacks to feed the monster in each round. When i learn that i fed too much calories to my monster, i tried to submit two items and it let me go to next round. So if i want to feed my monster at the lowest calories, i don't have to feed him any snacks at all? /  / I think you put too much emphasis on calories. Some high calories food are good for you, like nuts. Though nuts give me higher calories, they are packed with nutrition. High fat but they are good fat.  /  / When i feed the monster, i only choose the items that i would eat. I don't like gummy, popsicle, peanut butter, and hard candy. So even if i know those items MAYBE healthier or give less calories, i wouldn't feed that to my monster. 
gain,0
gain,I don't eat any of those kinds of snacks and am already pretty health-conscious/active so while I learned that certain snacks (that were already pretty unfamiliar to me) have more calories/fat/sugar than others, playing the game didn't change my own personal approach because it didn't feel like this study was targeted at me. Also because of the nature of my regular activities (long-distance running and rock climbing), my dietary habits anyway are not indicative of the general public's.

loss,Some of the images were a little blur, or squeezed, which I believe could be improved. 
gain,Very interesting study.
loss,To me, snacks also involve fresh fruit - so after the feeding the monster activity, I tried to align my view of "snack foods" to the game's view...
