loss,Honestly, for the made-up animal snacks, I only made my choice based on where the food was sourced from and the calorie count, and I just picked packaging since I had to have a third.

loss,Love the programming. Good job w the study. Have you thought of a turning per click events from Get More info buttons...to see if your participants want to know more and determine any correlation btw this effort/interest and their performance?

loss,I was actually really hoping to get some of those items. Some of them I haven't had since I was a kid. Granted, I could buy them now, but by spending money on it, I would feel guilty. This was an interesting and fun study. I really enjoyed it!
gain,With the reasons for choosing Snackazon, I felt like I was forced to pick three reasons, when often I only had one reason or two at most (usually, calories, then fat [which was not even an option] then taste). So I put "Didn't give much thought" as my third reason, because I mean, I didn't have a third reason. /  / Also the Monster Appetite was confusing, since I didn't know the size of a serving. Obviously, if you eat a whole jar of grape jelly, it's more calories than an ounce of pretzels... Also, in some cases I ran out of time to pick three items. Not sure what happens then. Sorry if I messed things up by not making a choice on time!

loss,This survey made me really aware of my eating habits and food choices. I will definitely try to make healthier choices in the future.
gain,When asked to select the "top three" reasons for picking an item in snackazon I did not know if considering the grams of sugars / fats was captured in "ingredients" or per-serving calories." To me this was frustrating because the composition of calories can be almost as important as just calorie amounts. Also, unless it was intentional, making me answer how I chose each item AFTER I had already rated all the items made it almost certain I had forgot my rationale. Instead, I wish I could have answered each item and then its rationale immediately. /  / Also, the game of selecting calories snacks was stressful. I hated that some "low calorie" items (e.g. jam) are actually not healthful because is almost all refined sugar. So when I was told to get "less calories" I felt like it was dumb, because to win I had to pick unhealthy items. Also, the items varied in calories (e.g. two popcorns could have different calories) but there was no way to select this. /  / Finally, asking me about snacking the questions seemed to conflate "eating a snack" with "eating snack foods." I snack a lot. But I eat things like: 10 almonds, celery with hummus, popcorn with no butter, one half piece of fruit. So my answers reflect that I don't think "snacks" are unhealthy nor will I stop eating them. However, I think SNACK FOODS, if you mean things like sugary cereal, candy, chips, or soda, than yes these are unhealthy.
loss,Good luck with your dissertation!

gain,I had to complete the second part of th study on mobile because I am traveling - I noted this in the comments box for the first part of the survey. I think everything went ok and I was careful when answering the questions but I just wanted to let you know since I sometimes had to scroll up and down the screen while playing the game. Thanks and best of luck with your research!!

gain,I also used how much fat and how much sugar was in certain items to make my choices, however these weren't among the categories I could choose from when listing my top 3 reason for choosing a food item
gain,I couldn''t take many of the choices offered very seriously. The kind of model for "healthy eating" that the study is based one seems outdated. I don't think dietitians would emphasize calorie counting this heavily but rather talk about balanced intake of different nutrients, fats, etc. The only thing that I really cared about in the health choices were the sourcing of ingredients and the sugar quantity (which I do try to limit). The game focuses solely on calories which I don't think makes sense? Is a popsicle, made of just water and sugar, really to be considered "healthier" than something like a protein bar? 
loss,this was fun and interesting

loss,When you have people do the last food selection, you should tell them it is the last time. Give them some idea of their progress when they get near the end. I thought I was caught in some endless loop, because I kept doing the same thing. 
gain,That was fun. I never could get the monster to smile or get out of the silver level.

loss,I think messaging would not change that much of my attitude, as I already know that snacks are bad for health.  /  / Also, in the Snakazon section, sometimes it was hard to see the difference in per-serving size (a piece of candy and a piece of brownie should not be treated in the same way, as their physical size are different, but I could not recognize that from the pictures). 
loss,I think there were too many items you had to choose on Snackazon before being taken to the page where you said why you chose certain items. Especially for the cartoonized labels, I couldn't remember all of the specifics for particular items (locality, calories, etc.) and so it was hard for me to remember why I chose certain items. Price also would be a factor, which wasn't included.

gain,Maria, it's Haya! I don't know if these are anonymous haha. Cool study! I'd like to see how the results turn out. I am curious as to the specific effect that sugar vs. fat content changes the selection process in the Snackathon game. Personally, I consider sugar to be the most dangerous aspect of snack food additives - I'm happy to eat snacks with more calories (and even more fat) as long as the sugar content is minimized. When I was selecting the "motivations" for snack selections, I didn't necessarily see a choice for that particular preference, so I selected "ingredients" across the board. Maybe this would have been too much a complicating factor in your study, but I would have been interested to see how the results would change if that was an option - or if the sugar and fat content of the snacks hadn't been provided. (In that case, for example, calorie content would have always been my number one concern). /  / Fun game, also, although it was hard! I took it very personally that I was struggling to reduce the overall calorie count of my monster's snacks :) Can I play again sometime? :) /  /

loss,Cool Study! It was fun to participate... Maybe I was not the best participant, because I already have a very clean eating habit... All snacks looked almost equally disgusting to me... I was like: "OK, if I absolutely HAVE to eat one of those, then I'm gonna pick the one with the least sugar and the least calories at least" ;)
