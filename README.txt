Specific tasks that I will do 

01. Learn GitHub better
02. Replace letters with food names (for now) - later food images
03. Make sure typed in food names are recognized by the system
04. Change the time limit of gameplay
05. Display calories of food items after timeover (flipped food cards on dice)
06. Multiplayer ability?
07. How are Tokens going to be incorporated? - food for thought
    - maybe some of the dice can become Tokens at times?
    - instructions should be clear on when it is time to take Tokens (or it is up to 
      the player to choose Tokens or not. Tokens can appear randomly at different 
      rounds and player may or may not choose it)
08. How is "winner" determined? Or will there be a winner at all?
    - if the below monster avatar will be incorporated then when played alone
      the too skinny monsters will lose and fat enough monsters will win???
09. Show a monster on the empty area of the game page and make it shrink/enlarge 
    depending on the calories consumed (range should be from 0/negative? up to 6000~
    7000 calories 
10.
